# aoc-2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles. All **50** stars!

All solutions are written in Python 3. Internally I've been using Jupyter Notebooks but in this
repository I've curated it somewhat and uploaded *.py* files.

## How to run

The files are organized so that the solution for the silver or gold star can be ran independently
of each other. If you feel like running one of my solutions it is probably easier to copy-paste
the solution for that star to a separate file and run that file instead.

### NOTE:
All solutions assumes there is a varaible named `input` that contains the *puzzle-input*.
